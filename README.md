# micro-gas-turbine-prediction
This project builds a machine learning pipeline to predict electrical power consumption. It includes data exploration, visualization, preprocessing, and model training using Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. The final model's feature importance is analyzed using SHAP values for interpretability.
